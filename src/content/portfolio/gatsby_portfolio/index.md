The website you are currently on! Gatsby seems to be very prevelant across the React community at the moment so I figured it would be worth learning and fun diving into. This is my first project built with Gatsby and I learned a lot about the infastructure of a Gatsby site. I also had fun creating parallax effect animations. This project was all about having fun while learning new technologies.
