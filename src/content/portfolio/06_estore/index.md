A complete up and running template for an online clothing store. Makes use of the Stripe API to charge credit cards for payments. Firebase handles user authentication and cart items are saved to the Firestore. This is just a template for now as it only uses the test version of the Stripe API, but can easily be converted into a real online store by switching versions of the API.
