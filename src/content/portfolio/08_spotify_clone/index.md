A full fledged Spotify music player clone built with React/Redux. After logging in to your Spotify account you will be directed to a homepage where you can browse, like, and save new music. Created with the Spotify API which gives us info on songs, artists, albums, and playlists. The API only gives out 30 second song previews, but it can still be very useful for finding new music that you'd like to save to your account.
